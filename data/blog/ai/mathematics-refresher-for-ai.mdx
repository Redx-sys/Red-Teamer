## Basic Arithmetic Operations

#### Multiplication
```
2 * 2 = 4
```

#### Division
```
2 / 2 = 1
``` 

#### Addition
```
2 + 2 = 4
```

#### Subtraction
```
2 - 2 = 0
``` 

## Algebraic Notations

#### Subscript Notation (x_t)
This notation is commonly used in sequences and time series, where each x_t represents the value of x at time t.
```
x_t = q(x_t | x_{t-2})
```

x_t is read as “x at time t.” The subscript t is just a number that marks the turn: day 1, day 2, day 3... (or step 1, step 2, step 3).

Imagine you have a notebook where you write something down **every day**.
x_1: what happened on day 1
x_2: what happened on day 2
x_3: what happened on day 3
...and so on.

##### What does x_t=q(x_t | x_{t−2}) mean?

- x_t: “what happens today (at time t)”
- x_t - 2: “what happened two days ago”
- The bar | is read as “given” or “according to.”
- q: It is a rule or model that uses what happened two days ago to determine what happens today.

So, it reads like this:
> “Today I decide using a rule that looks at what happened two days ago.”

##### 1) Rule that gives a number (deterministic)

Here, q returns **the exact value** for today.

Example:

Rule: x_t = 0.5 . x_t - 2  (“Today's value is **half** of the value from two days ago.”)

If you know: x1 = 10 and x2 = 8

You calculate:

##### 2) Rule that gives possibilities (probabilistic)
Here q does not give you a fixed number, it gives you **probabilities** of what today might be, **based on** what happened 2 days ago.

**Super simple “weather” example:**
- If **two days ago it was “Sunny,”** then **today**:
    - 80% “Sunny”
    - 20% “Rain”
- If **two days ago it was “Rainy”**, then **today**:
    - 30% “Sunny”
    - 70% “Rainy”
This is written as q(x_t ∣ x_t−2)

Translation: “**Today's chances** depend on **how it was two days ago**.”

> In this case, x_t appears inside q( ) because it is the thing we want to decide (what value it takes today), and xt−2 is the clue we use to decide.

##### Simple exercises:

A. Fixed rule (numbers):

x_t = x_t-2 + 3, x_1=4 and x_2=6

Calculate: x_3, x_4, and x_5

**B. Probability rule (weather):**

If it was “Rain” two days ago, today there is a 70% chance of ‘Rain’ and a 30% chance of “Sun.”
The **most likely prediction** for today is “**Rain**.”


## Exercise Solutions
A. Fixed rule (numbers)
* (x_3 = x_{1} + 3 = 4 + 3 = \mathbf{7})
* (x_4 = x_{2} + 3 = 6 + 3 = \mathbf{9})
* (x_5 = x_{3} + 3 = 7 + 3 = \mathbf{10})

**Resultado:** (x_3=7), (x_4=9), (x_5=10).
