## Basic Arithmetic Operations

### Multiplication
```
2 * 2 = 4
```

### Division
```
2 / 2 = 1
``` 

### Addition
```
2 + 2 = 4
```

### Subtraction
```
2 - 2 = 0
``` 

## Algebraic Notations

### Subscript Notation (x_t)
This notation is commonly used in sequences and time series, where each `x_t` represents the value of `x` at time `t`.
```
x_t = q(x_t | x_{t-2})
```

`x_t` is read as “x at time t.” The subscript t is just a number that marks the turn: day 1, day 2, day 3... (or step 1, step 2, step 3).

Imagine you have a notebook where you write something down **every day**.
x_1: what happened on day 1
x_2: what happened on day 2
x_3: what happened on day 3
...and so on.

#### What does ```x_t=q(x_t | x_{t−2})``` mean?

- x_t: “what happens today (at time t)”
- x_t - 2: “what happened two days ago”
- The bar | is read as “given” or “according to.”
- q: It is a rule or model that uses what happened two days ago to determine what happens today.

So, it reads like this:
> Today I decide using a rule that looks at what happened two days ago.

#### 1) Rule that gives a number (deterministic)

Here, q returns **the exact value** for today.

Example:

Rule: x_t = 0.5 . x_t - 2  (“Today's value is **half** of the value from two days ago.”)

If you know: x1 = 10 and x2 = 8

You calculate:

#### 2) Rule that gives possibilities (probabilistic)
Here q does not give you a fixed number, it gives you **probabilities** of what today might be, **based on** what happened 2 days ago.

**Super simple “weather” example:**
- If **two days ago it was “Sunny,”** then **today**:
    - 80% “Sunny”
    - 20% “Rain”
- If **two days ago it was “Rainy”**, then **today**:
    - 30% “Sunny”
    - 70% “Rainy”
This is written as q(x_t ∣ x_t−2)

Translation: “**Today's chances** depend on **how it was two days ago**.”

> In this case, x_t appears inside q( ) because it is the thing we want to decide (what value it takes today), and xt−2 is the clue we use to decide.

#### Simple exercises:

A. Fixed rule (numbers):

x_t = x_t-2 + 3, x_1=4 and x_2=6

Calculate: x_3, x_4, and x_5

**B. Probability rule (weather):**

If it was “Rain” two days ago, today there is a 70% chance of ‘Rain’ and a 30% chance of “Sun.”
The **most likely prediction** for today is “**Rain**.”

**B. Probability rule (weather):**

If it was “Rain” two days ago, today there is a 70% chance of ‘Rain’ and a 30% chance of “Sun.”

## Superscript Notation
Superscript notation is used to denote exponents or powers. For example:
```
x^2 = x * x 
```

If X=2
x^2 = 2 * 2 = 4
X^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 =  8

## Norm 
The norm measures the size or length of a vector. 
The norms are used in various applications, such as measuring the distance between vectors, regularizing models to avoid overfitting, and normalizing data.

### What is a vector?

A vector is simply **a short list of numbers**. In 2D, for example, v=(x,y).
You can imagine it as **an arrow** from (0,0) to the point (x,y).

The **norm** is “**how long is the arrow**.”
Different standards = **different rules** for measuring that length.

### Three famous rules (with visual idea)

- L2 (Euclidean) = direct diagonal
![l2](/static/images/ai/mathematics_refresher_for_ai_part_1/2.png)
It is the “normal” straight tape measure.

- L1 (Manhattan) = by the block
![l1](/static/images/ai/mathematics_refresher_for_ai_part_1/3.png)
You can only go right/left and up/down (like streets on a grid).

- L∞ (infinity) = the largest deviation
![li](/static/images/ai/mathematics_refresher_for_ai_part_1/4.png)
Look how far you went in one direction (the greater of the two).

### A super easy example: v=(2,1)

- L2 norm: √(2² + 1²) = √5 ≈ 2.24
- L1 norm: |2| + |1| = 3
3 steps through streets (2 to the right + 1 up)    
- L∞ norm: max(|2|, |1|) = 2
2 → your greatest deviation was “2” on the X-axis.

> The three numbers are different because the measuring rule is different.

### Exercise:
4) v=(3,4)

Solve it for L2, L1, and L∞.

## Exercises Solutions
A. Fixed rule (numbers)
* (x_3 = x_{1} + 3 = 4 + 3 = \mathbf{7})
* (x_4 = x_{2} + 3 = 6 + 3 = \mathbf{9})
* (x_5 = x_{3} + 3 = 7 + 3 = \mathbf{10})

**Resultado:** (x_3=7), (x_4=9), (x_5=10).

B. Probability rule (weather)
The **most likely prediction** for today is “**Rain**.”

C. v=(3,4)

- L2 norm: √(3² + 4²) = √25 = 5
- L1 norm: |3| + |4| = 7
7 steps through streets (3 to the right + 4 up)
- L∞ norm: max(|3|, |4|) = 4
4 → your greatest deviation was “4” on the Y-axis.
