As a Penetration Tester my expertise extends to Web Application Security, where I leverage my strong 
foundation in frontend development to create secure and user-friendly interfaces. Certified in [eJPT](https://certs.ine.com/b127ccd7-1653-4575-b0c2-089abd62e536#gs.bbf6bv), [eWPT](https://certs.ine.com/3044d2c0-2909-4725-8bfc-1441c004b414#gs.bbf693) and [eWPTX](https://certs.ine.com/ebed1996-53e3-4d3c-8710-efd59525aa33#gs.bbf67m)
I have recently ventured into mobile security, starting with Android. My goal is to explore 
and strengthen security measures on mobile platforms, ensuring users can navigate safely in today's ever-changing digital landscape.
I created this blog with the intention of sharing my experience and what I am learning in the field of mobile security.
